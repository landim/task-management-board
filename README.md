A MVP of a task management board similar to Trello and Jira.

## Backlog

The main features of this app are:

- User should be able to add a Card to a column by clicking “Add another card”
- When you add another card, you are able to add in Description Text
- User can edit the text in a Card by hovering over the Card and clicking the Edit pencil
icon (this can just be text)
- When editing a card (Diag. 2, below) the background goes dark and you can edit,
save, and delete the card.

- User can re-arrange the order of the Cards in a Column
- User can also move a Card from one column to another
- User can also edit the Names of the Columns by clicking on the Name

| ---------- | :----------: | :------------: | :------: |
| [Initial UI](https://github.com/landim/task-management-board/issues/1) | 3 | 21 | 7 |

### Assumptions

- The app starts with a fixed set of cards;
- To edit column name, just click on it and hit Enter or Esc when done;

### Room for improvements

1. Refactor Cards and Columns components to share same title editing feature;
1. Add tests to ensure that drag and drop of cards will not loose or duplicate them;
1. Create an entity to represent Board and make it possible to have multiple Boards;

## Setup and run

### Requirements

- docker
- docker compose

### Development

Executing for the first time:
`docker build -t tasks:dev .`

This will create the docker instance with a hot reload. So any changes on files will be reflected on the running app.

Open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

After first run it wont be necessary to build the instance every run:
`docker-compose up`

*if new packages/dependencies are added, it is necessary to rebuild the image*
